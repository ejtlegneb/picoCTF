# Step 1:
Read the code that is running on the server and try to compile it. During compilation `gcc vuln.c` I got the output: 
`vuln.c:93:9: warning: format string is not a string literal (potentially insecure) [-Wformat-security]`

# Step 2:
Read about this insecurity, In the code we did a malloc with 301 bytes. I ran the code twice with 300 times `%x` as input.
This gave back what is in memory at that point. I ran it twice to see which part of the block is consistent.
If you start reading the individual bytes we can find the flag.

# Step 3:
Write some python script `helper.py` to extract the ascii characters from the bytes in hex.
