# Step 1:
Look into the binary file.

# Step 2:
do a search for `picoCTF`, and this is how I found the flag in the binary file.

# Conclusion:
Looking add the hints I think they wanted you to run this binary on your system. 
While doing this you will learn the chmod command and to know about that most programs have -h flag.
Unfortunately, I ran into errors about wrong architecture to run this binary (also in linux).
As I already had the flag I considered this solution solved.
