Step 1:
Look at the metadata of the file. At first I couldn't see anything special about it, after some googling I came across this command line tool called `Exiftool`.

Step 2:
Decode the license from base64.

Conclusion:
I got to the point of reading the output of Exiftool. From this point I got stuck as I didn't suspect the flag to be hidden in the license. This was because I was unaware of how a license should look like nor did I recognize it being base64. I have to really attentively look at everything when stuck.
