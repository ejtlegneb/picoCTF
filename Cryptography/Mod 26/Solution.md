Step 1:
As I didn't know what ROT13 was, I just googled it.

Step 2:
After reading about ROT13 (ROT13 (Rotate13, "rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the Latin alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome.) I just went on a decypher site to get the flag from the description.
