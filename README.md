I will use this as a personal log:

After doing the second exercise in the Cryptography named P and Q's I feel like I do not really enjoy these questions.
I will start focussing on one subject from now on and that will be General Skills. I might venture out to another topic if I am stuck on it.
But cryptography is just very math heavy, which right now is not my strong suit.
